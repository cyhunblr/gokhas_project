# gokhas_project
GokHAS was developed as a bachelorâ€™s thesis project. It integrates a custom two-axis turret with an Airsoft system. A GUI-based centralized management software architecture enables precision target engagement. The embedded system uses an STM32 microcontroller communicating via UART.
